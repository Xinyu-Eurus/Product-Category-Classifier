# Product-Category-Classifier

This project is to train and evaluate a classifier that predicts the category from the product title, rating and review text from a fictitious e-commerce dataset. I only use a logistic regression model and encode the features by bi-gram model. I focus on the data integration steps, the code readability and the reproducibility and practicality.
